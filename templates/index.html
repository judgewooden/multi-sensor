        <h1>Welcome to JPH Monitor</h1>
        <p>I have multiple computers on one water cooling loop. The water travels through my walls to a cupboard outside where a radiator get rid of the heat. This is a monitoring tool to view the status of the system.</p>
        <p>The component diagram shows all the components I use the monitor the system. The Arduino monitors two flow sensors and has a fail-safe feature to automatically switch of the power, and avoid the pumps from running dry when I am not home.<p>

   The pi-kast monitors the temperature of the radiator and ambient temperature. 
   The pi-host monitors the temperature on the manifold inside and reads zwave power meters.
   The pi-monitor run this web-page, which is build on the JPH messaging.
